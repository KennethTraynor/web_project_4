# Project 9: Around The U.S.

This website focuses on integrating javascript into a webpage. It uses javascript to give the website important functionality and allow for more complex user interactions.

## Functionality

* This website uses javascript to make buttons and forms functional

* The website also uses a responsive layout to make sure it works on smaller scales

* Added form validation to make sure users do not get confused when inputting data

## Technologies & Techniques

**Technologies:**

* Visual Studio Code: Website code

* Figma: Layout reference for final webpage

* Git: Used to work in different branches in order to manage the development of the website's features

* Github: Keeping the code for the webpage and hosting it with Github Pages

**Techniques:**

* Javascript was used to add some functionality to the page, making it possible to edit values and validate form inputs

* Templates were used to make new cards using javascript by cloning the template and giving it new values

* Flex and Grid layouts were used in order to shape the website

* Used non-fixed values for widths and heights where appropriate

* Made use of text-overflow for adding ellipsis to text that did not fit it's bounds

* The website uses classes to separate code into its functional parts, there is no difference to what the end user sees, but the code is easier to maintain and the classes add modularity

* The website makes use of an Api, which allows data to be uploaded and loaded onto the page. It also allows for other users to load specific values onto their instance of the website

* Fetch methods and promises are used in order to make code run asynchronously. Some examples are waiting for an image to load or waiting for a server response, while still being able to execute other code on the page.
