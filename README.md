# Project 4: Around The U.S.

This website focused on integrating javascript into a webpage. In this case it was something simple, but it is a good example of how javascript can be used to make a website functional versus simply being visually appealing.

## Functionality

* This website uses javascript to make buttons and forms functional

* The website also uses a responsive layout to make sure it works on smaller scales

## Technologies & Techniques

**Technologies:**

* Visual Studio Code: Website code

* Figma: Layout reference for final webpage

* Git: Used to work in different branches in order to manage the development of the website's features

* Github: Keeping the code for the webpage and hosting it with Github Pages

**Techniques:**

* Javascript was used to add some functionality to the page, making it possible to edit values that otherwise would not be possible

* Templates were used to make new cards using javascript by cloning the template and giving it new values

* Flex and Grid layouts were used in order to shape the website

* Used non-fixed values for widths and heights where appropriate

* Made use of text-overflow for adding ellipsis to text that did not fit it's bounds
